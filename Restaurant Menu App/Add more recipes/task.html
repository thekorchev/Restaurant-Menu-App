<p>
  Our composable MenuItem is working, but the menu has more than
  just Fettuccine. Let's display a list of MenuItem with all
  the recipes on menu.
</p>
<p>
  The logic for each MenuItem should take into consideration
  the stock for that specific item
  and restrict the order's amount like was done on last stage.
</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ol>
<li>
    Each composable MenuItem has
    a recipe name,
    a plus,
    an order amount
    and a minus
    like the one that already exists for Fettuccine.
  </li>
<li>
    Use the following data that represent
    the relation between recipe name and stock amount
    <br/><br/>
<pre><code class="java">
    val recipesNameToStockAmount = mapOf(
            "Fettuccine" to 5,
            "Risotto" to 6,
            "Gnocchi" to 4,
            "Spaghetti" to 3,
            "Lasagna" to 5,
            "Steak Parmigiana" to 2
    )</code></pre><br/>
</li>
<li>
    Create one MenuItem for each recipe
  </li>
<li>
    Each recipe has it's own orderAmount and stockAmount
    and the logic for each MenuItem should take only
    it's own recipe into consideration
  </li>
<li>
    Display all recipes as a list of MenuItem
  </li>
</ol>
