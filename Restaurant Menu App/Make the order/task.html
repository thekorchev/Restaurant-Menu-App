<p>
  Waiters can input the amount ordered for every
  item on menu, but they still can't register the
  order.
</p>
<p>
  Let's add a button to register the order.
  When an order is made send a visual feedback
  with the order summary.
  Also the amount stock should be decreased,
  the order amount for each item should be reset to zero
  and the limit on new orders should follow the new stock state.
</p>
<h5 id="objectives">Objectives</h5>
<ol>
<li>
    Add a <code class="java">Button</code>
    with background color black
    and content color white.
    Inside the <code class="java">Button</code>
    add a <code class="java">Text</code>
    with text <code class="java">"Make Order"</code>
    and font size <code class="java">24sp</code>
</li>
<li>
    Add an <code class="java">onClick</code> listener on the button
    that trigger an event to register the order
    <ul>
<li>
        If the button is clicked
        with all order quantities equal to zero
        then do nothing
      </li>
<li>
        If the button is clicked
        and one item only has quantity greater than zero
        then Toast a message with the following format
        <code class="java">
          "Ordered:\n==&gt; ${recipeName}: $orderAmount"
        </code>
        and update the stock amount of that recipe
      </li>
<li>
        If the button is clicked
        and many items have quantity greater than zero
        then Toast a message that besides the same
        header as the case above
        also has one line for each of those items
        using the same recipe line format as the case above
        and update the stock of each ordered item
      </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
    After an order is made
    <ul>
<li>Update the stock amount</li>
<li>
        Visual cues and limit to order amount should follow
        the new state of stock amount
      </li>
<li>
        Prepare to receive new orders by resetting
        ordered amount to 0
      </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
